# DownRadar
Web app to check the down status of a domain and subscribe to alerts

A quick 2hour .Net Core web app portfolio piece to highlight and demonstrate the following:
  * The MVC architecture
  * Reusable and interchangeable code through the use of interfaces, inheritance and Dependency Injection
  * Use of third party packages including Twilio for SMS messages and Dapper for database access
  * Connection to a Azure database
  
 Points to highlight:
  * This app, for monatary reasons, currently uses appsettings to store cridentials though would be linked to a vault such as Azure's KeyVault if done in a professional work setting.
 
 NOTE:
  Depending on when this is used, I may have discontinued my subscription with Twilio and therefor this application will no longer send out text messages to unverified numbers.
  The code will still remain in place for your viewing pleasure.
